				<h2>Karaage: A Guilty Pleasure</h2>
				<h3>Rethinking the way we look at one of the iconic comfort foods</h3>
				<p>Date: 06/30/2016 | Written by: BENTOGOMAN</p>
				<p>When it comes to food in Japan, many people would think of sushi, ramen or the fantastic variety of alcoholic beverages. It may come as a shock, but like many westerners, Japanese people enjoy fried foods and is part of their main diet in a common household. If we have fried chicken in the west, then in the east, they have Karaage; a different take on one of the most iconic comfort foods ever. Karaage is found in Japanese lunches, street food and even accompanied with alcoholic beverages. Simple in preparation but yet complex in its flavor, it is no surprise that Karaage is one of the most beloved food in Japan.  </p>

				<p>Karaage is commonly known for its fried chicken variation. However, Karaage also refers to any food that is deep fried in oil. Other examples of Karaage include octopus, squid tentacles, perch and so on. Because of their simplicity in preparation, Karaage can be easily found around Japan. Unlike fried chicken that we enjoy in the west, which are large pieces of chicken with bones, Karaage consists of small bite size pieces which has no bones.  </p>
