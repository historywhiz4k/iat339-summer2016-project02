				<h2>What's in your Bento?</h2>
				<h3>A wise man once said "You are what you eat"; so what are you eating today?</h3>
				<p>Date: 06/27/2016 | Written by: JOHNDOETO</p>
				<p>While the common image of a lunch in the west is a sandwich, bento, or boxed lunches is the king of the lunch in asian countries. While they are two different types of lunch itmes, the concept is the same. A sandwich contains all the foods contained between two pieces of bread while a bento has all the foods you want contained in a box. Vancouver is arguably one of the most multicultural cities in the world. With this multiculturalism, it brings various different food venues for the community to enjoy. As a result, many people are moving away from packing sandwiches, to picking unique lunch options to satisfy their appetite. So what makes a Bento an appealing option for your lunch?  </p>

				<p>The box that contains the food comes in many different forms. Some may have dividers or different compartments while some have all the space for the chef to fill it with. The traditional way of filling a bento is fill one half with rice and the rest with side dishes. As different recipes were introduced, many chefs or people alike started putting different types of food in the bento box. The look of the bento lunches have changed as well. What began with simple rice and side dishes now become artistic dishes with character designs filled with color and attitude. This made bento's a more popular item among school children as well as office workers.</p>

				<p>Bento is now a staple item in Japanese culture where it has become a necessity in every day travel. It is impossible not to find a Bento stand in one form or another in many of the major train stations, giving the riders a meal to munch on for their long travles. There are also region exclusive bentos which is considered to be a good tourist attraction and bento fanatic collector's item. There is also the new year's bento, which is considered to be the first meal welcoming the new year. This bento is much more expensive than your average bento with prices almost reaching a hundred dollars but for a good reason. The foods packed in these new year's bento are high quality and each component by themselves can be considered high quality culinary dishes. We at BENTOGO want to spread the wonderful world of Bentos to the people of Vancouver to share the fun and novelty that a bento brings. </p>
